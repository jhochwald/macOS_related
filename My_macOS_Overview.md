# macOS Overview

My Mac Setup is simple. Nothing fancy!

## Software

A quick overview of the software that I use most.

### Commercial

#### 1Password

My life saver! With all the logins and passwords, a password manager is a must, at least for me.

#### Bookmark Sorter

Sorts my Safari Bookmarks.

#### CleanMyMac 3

I like CleanMyMac and I use it since a long time. Tested CleanMyMac X, but decided to stay with the old version for now!

#### Coda 2

Coda 2 works perfect for me! I can sync Sites and projects accross devices.

#### Google Chrome

I use Google Chrome only for a few things. Most of my daily browsing is done with Safari.

#### Microsoft Office 2016

No brainer! I use Office 365 a lot and most of the documents from 3rd parties are in the Microsoft Office format.
It replaced a lot of other services over the years. I migrated most of my (pages and numbers) data. The collaboration features are the killer feature here.

#### Parallels Desktop

Where I run my virtual systems. You might use another solution here, like VirtualBox or VMware Fusion. I use Parallels for a long time.

#### Paw

Paw makes the interaction with REST services delightful. I use Paw daily!

#### Postman

I still use Postman for some REST services. But I replaced most of my work with Paw.

#### Royal TSX

My Admin access toolbelt! This awesome software makes remote access to nearly everything easy and simple! One of my favorite apps!

#### ScreenSteps

I still use ScreenSteps! It's my last 32 Bit application (Stiil use 2.9.7) to avoid the update with the creapy licensing and pricing modell. I will miss ScreenSteps :(

#### Skype for Business

Mostly replaced by Microsoft Teams, but for a few things Skype for Business is still in use (Skype Meetings and external communication aka Federation with other Skype fpr Business and Lync Users)

#### Spotify

My old Music Stream service. I still have the client installed, but most of my streaming is now handled by iTues (Apple Music).

#### Sublime Text

My long time favorite editor! Since Visual Studio Code is availible, I transfered a lot of my workflows and projects. I still use Sublime for my old projects (where a migrations makes no sense for me). Still a great editor!

#### TeamViewer

LEGACY: I still use TeamViewer to access and manage customer systems. But I still use a very old version! Try to avoid the update cause I disagree with what TeamViewer did with the pricing modell.

### Open Source and/or Freeware

#### Chromium

The Open Source roots of Chrome.

#### ControlPlane

Make moving between networks easier for me. I have tweaked everything and I have a lot of workflows that ControlPlane trigegrs for me.

#### Cyberduck

Cyberduck is the best FTP/SFTP GUI Client in my opinion. It's freeware, but you should think about a donaition here :)

#### Firefox

I still use Firefox a lot. Not only for testing websites. Since a while, the Mozilla browser is getting better again...

#### iTerm

The Terminal replacement! One of the first things I install on every Mac!

#### MacDown

A great Markdown editor!

#### Mark Text

Electron based Markdown editor. Since a while I use it more, and more... For bigger documents.

#### Microsoft OneDrive

Availible as free download from Microsoft. You might want to use the App Store version instead.
I switched from DropBox to OneDrive a while ago! And with the new selective Sync feature of OneNote it is perfect for my use case(s). And I can manage multiple Accounts with one Solution, without mixing or merge the data. I can use my personal OneDrive and Multiple Office 365 (commercial) OneDrive accounts. And since a while it's easy to access the Document Libraries of SharePoint Sites. All in one place.

#### Microsoft Teams

The favorite collaboration solution for us! Still miss a few things here and there.

#### NoMAD

Kerberos based on my Active Directory Account! I no longer bind my Mac to the Active Directory...

#### Platypus

I use Platypus to build small packages based on little scripts. Nothing Fancy.

#### PowerShell

Since PowerShell Core is availible I use it more and more native, on my Mac!

#### SourceTree

Whenever I need a GIT GUI, SourceTree is my favorite. I use a lot of Atlassian Products, so it was a perfect fit. I replaced Tower, my long time favorite GIT Client a while ago.

#### Visual Studio Code

My absolute favorite Editor! I used a lot of Sublime before, but thanks to electron VS Code is a perfect match. But It's Open Souce and I can use it everywhere without licensing every system. And with a few extensions (That is the real magic of VS Code) it is very powerfull!!!

#### Visual Studio Code - Insiders

To test new features. I use Visual Studio Code most of the time.

#### VLC

Video LAN Client: The best Multi Platform Video Player!

#### Wireshark

Any questions? Honestly, this is one of the core components for my job :)

### App Store

I still have a few applications from the App Store installed.

#### 1Blocker

I still try to find a better solution, but for now 1Blocker is still my favorit! Sync accross devices and support on the iPhone/iPad makes it a no brainer.

#### Apple Configurator 2

Any questions? :-)

#### Archiver

Formerly known as Rucksack! Handles all the archives that my Mac can't.

#### iConvert Icons

Perfect for create or convert Icons... For Websites, Apps and much more!

#### Keynote

I use Keynote to create slides. I still use it more then PowerPoint... But PowerPoint fits perfect in my daily Workflow and the Office 365 services that I use.

#### Microsoft OneNote

I replaced all my other Note taking and Todo Applications with OneNote a while ago. It fits perfect into my Office 365 workflows and together with Microsoft Teams it became a kilelr app for me.
It dropped Evernote a while ago and I use Notes (Apple) just on my mobile devices from time to time. Don't get me wrong here: It's a great app and due to to iCloud sync it works on all my devices, but OneNote integrates into Office 365 very, very, deeply.

#### Microsoft Remote Desktop

I use this a lot to access RDP hosts.

#### Numbers

In my case more a legacy app! I replaced it with Excel a long time ago.

#### Pages

Like Numbers: Legacy and replaced mostly with Word.

#### Remote Desktop (Apple)

I need to support a lot of Mac based systems. I use Apple Remote Desktop since ages to do that.

#### SubEthaEdit

One of my legacy Editory! The first one that allowed multiple editors (prople) at the same time to work on the same document in realtime via Bonjour.

#### Xcode

I still do some Objective-C and Swift stuff.
